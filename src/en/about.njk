title: About Jal Jarokha
about: <p>Jal Jharokha is a collaborative project of the Mehrangarh Museum Trust and the Living Waters Museum to visualize stories of Water Heritage from Mehrangarh Fort and the Old City of Jodhpur. A search for water wisdom, the Jal Jharokha project engaged communities, especially youth, to explore the interplay of absence and abundance over the desert landscapes of Jodhpur. The idea of this virtual exhibition emerged during the long COVID-19 lockdowns in August 2021 which was followed by fieldwork, many rich collaborations, an onsite field workshop in December 2021 and in the end taking the form of a virtual exhibition which was launched in February 2023. The eight stories in the virtual exhibition have a geographical focus which is limited to Mehrangarh Fort and its adjacent area of the historic city also known as the Old City of Jodhpur. However, towards the end of the project, the curatorial team believed that much more could be explored within and beyond the existing scope and hence this exhibition marks only the beginning of this body of work to visualize water heritage stories from Jodhpur and Rajasthan. </p>

    about: '<p>Work of art and music has the power to create a different world for a moment. These temporary worlds are shaped by the unbounded imagination of artists, their expressions that create a specific mood, to transport us somewhere between the real and the fantastical. Jodhpur has rich traditions of such artistic practices which flourished over centuries by royal patronage and cultural practices of common people. This story sheds light on only a few of the many examples of traditional music and miniature paintings that revered aspects of the water in the artistic history of Jodhpur.</p>'

    about: <p>"The historic city of Jodhpur lies on the eastern edge of the Thar Desert with no perineal river anywhere close by and lowest annual rainfall. Jodhpur thrived on monsoon-driven water harvested from its local catchments into a multitude of lakes, tanks, wells, bawaris, jhalaras and taankas. A highly efficient indigenous system of collection, storage and access. With the advent of piped water supply sourced from remote locations, the rich heritage of water was abandoned and got reduced to ruins. Amidst the growing challenge of deepening water crisis, it has become imperative to revive and iterate the indigenous water systems. Museums are apt for re-visiting the water heritage of the country and inspire communities to restore their ancient water systems to achieve fresh-water sufficiency."</p>

    about: <p>"The erasing from public memory, the spatiality of water, has eroded fundamental relationships between society, environment, and other aspects of human endeavour as historic systems languish while modern water infrastructure is concealed, hidden and devoid of any human interaction. My research on the water structures of Jodhpur has shown them to be thoughtful and strategic interventions in the urban landscape which have also provided beautiful public spaces. The book, Spatial Ecology of Water, demonstrates the relation between design and infrastructure that integrates structural stability with socio-cultural requirements, strategic connections with other water structures and the hydrogeology of the region, a tremendously valuable knowledge system and infrastructure that needs to be conserved and integrated into our present urban life."</p>
