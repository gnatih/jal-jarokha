  <div class="two-column">
    <p>The chowk where the Tunwar Ji ka Jhalra is located was known to be a highly populated area, which makes it clear that it was one of the most used Jhalra in the locality. The waterbody was constructed in the year 1748 A.D.The traces of the installation of the Persian wheel ensure that water from one edge was drawn via a wheel system driven by a pair of bullocks circling the platform on top. In contrast, in the other three edges, the beautiful crisscross flight makes the vertical access to fetch water. It is 200 feet deep, with beautiful carvings on all the edges of the inner tank. With the shadow of the steps, the entire surface gains an abstract quality, dematerializing the stone and softening its harshness. They counter the inward thrust of the earth, exemplifying the integration of architecture and structure. The end of this jhalra once again connects to the sky through the reflections and the sharp shaft of light into the well. The artistry of the stepwell has been done in an exquisite manner depicting perfection in engineering. Cow and Lion shaped waterspouts were carved for giving the water outlet. Viewing galleries also known as Jharokhas are constructed around the steps that were used to keep lamps to illuminate the place at night. These are now used as a platform to dive deep into the water with the locals.</p>

    <p>In present times, the chowk is known as The Stepwell Square after the restoration of Jhalra in 2015. In the process, the excavations went down over two hundred feet to expose hand-carved treasures in Jodhpurâ€™s famous rose-red sandstone; including intricate carvings of dancing elephants, medieval lions, and cow water-spouts, as well as niches housing deities long gone. Due to the urban Regeneration project catered by JDH, It has become a platform of different retail brands, sundowner cafes, and hotels overlooking the waterbody and having the fort at its Rooftop view. </p>
