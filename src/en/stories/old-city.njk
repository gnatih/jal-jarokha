subtitle: Water Hertiage in Old City of Jodhpur
about: '<p>Rao Jodha founded Jodhpur on Pachetia Hill, as in this area, there was an immense potential for harvesting and collecting rainwater and perennial water springs were visibly flowing between the rocks. The system that was discovered 500 years back, is still functional and is still serving usable water to many spaces and people. </p>'

  - title: Padamsar Lake
    about: '<p>Adjoining Rani sar is the second most prominent water body of the old city of Jodhpur, Padam Sar. Its construction was sanctioned by different patrons at different stages, the major being Rani Utamde, Padam Shah of Mewar, and Rani Devvadijee of Rao Ganga. An outlet present at a lower level of Ranisar&apos;s overflow acts as a main source of water. When Padam sar gets filled up the brimming water flows from the top of the embankment and then right through the city. </p><p>The above arrangement of the overflow of Ranisar into Padamsar was provided as per the engineering skill during Rao Maldeo&apos;s time and is still continuing.</p>'

The water of this well is known for its medicinal properties, due to this reason water fetching from here was directly governed by Jodhpur Fort via their kiledar(head guard of the fort) or kotwal (regional police officer). If any common man urged to use the water for any medicinal reason or even for any religious purpose, the required amount of water was provided to the man, post the permission of kiledar. Keeping in mind the importance of water, a soldier was always on duty to guard the fetch of water. </p>'

  - title: Community Wells
    id: community-wells
    about: '<p>Water bodies were also commissioned by different communities. As Meghal Arya talks about The system on any water body, ensured the presence of a network of diverse, open spaces in an otherwise dense and compact city integrating access to water with public spaces of all scales. At these wells, which are found in every chowk, which catered to residents of a community, groups of people would collect and spend time together. <img src="/images/old-city/community-wells/community-wells.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid w-100 my-3"> Even the smallest Kua/bera/well had a plinth or an otla or steps, a tree, and often a pavilion as elements that enabled the social space. Spilled water was collected in troughs for animals, a manifestation of the interstitial spaces of cultural expression of a society with a strong bond to animals in everyday life. The tree is often the Peepal tree that has religious significance. The daily prayers are recited here. Bird Feeders are placed here.</p>'

  - title: Journey of Matka
    id: journey-of-matka
    about: '<p>Matka is a local word used for Earthen Pot. It is usually made from mud clay. The clay is mixed with water shaped, finished, polished, dried, and baked. At last, it becomes an entire pot, the most common drinking water cooler in the Indian Subcontinent. It keeps the water cool from the process of evaporative cooling. Capillary action causes water to evaporate from the tiny pores in the pot, taking the heat from the water inside, thus making the water inside cooler than the outside temperature. </p><p>The spaces where the matkas are kept are the most religious and sacred spaces of the Rajasthani household. The putting up of matkas every summer is done according to an auspicious day and time. The parinda has quite basic niches or ledges in the wall with circular rings at the bottom to hold the pots. In a residential space, in ancient times two parindas were constructed, The first right near the entry for passersby to drink water and the other one inside the kitchen for drinking purposes. </p><p>The journey of Matka thus showcased here talks about its journey from a Potter&apos;s space to a vendor&apos;s shop followed by its use either as a household drinking pot or a public drinking amenity. When the pot is not of use, and winters make their way the pot thus acts in different roles and then ends its journey when fragmented for different reasons.</p>'

  <h3>Water into the Old City</h3>
  <p>Water collected via rainwater in large catchments percolates into the ground and due to the nature of the rock, it travels through its fissures making natural pathways. Thus, all the water structures like bawdis, jhalaras, bera, and kunds are constructed on these natural pathways.  As stated by Meghal Arya in Spatial Ecology Of Water purely, the water system in Jodhpur depends on seepage, percolation, and holding water in the rock strata. The water from hills and the higher regions flows into reservoirs and further into the city enabled by the natural gradient. Jodhpur thus developed downstream poised to receive the water. This is the reason why a set of water bodies would be observed to be constructed in a connected network.</p>

  <h3>Street from Padamsar to Navchokiya</h3>
  <p>The historical entrance that connected The walled city to the Mehrangarh fort has Two lakes beside it. Rani Sar for the use of fort and Padam Sar which was open for public use. The street that connects Fort&apos;s This entrance to walled city is again set up on a hilly terrain which sustains as foothills of Mehrangarh Fort. Because of the presence of This hilly terrain, the dwelling has a natural gradient thus enabling the flow of water.
