subtitle: Water Heritage in the <br> Old City of Jodhpur
about: '<p>Rao Jodha founded Jodhpur on Pachetia Hill, as in this area, there was an immense potential for harvesting and collecting rainwater and perennial water springs were visibly flowing between the rocks. The system that was discovered 500 years back, is still functional and is still serving usable water to many spaces and people. </p>'

  - title: Padamsar Lake
    about: '<p>Padamsar, adjoining Ranisar, is the second most prominent water body of the old city of Jodhpur. Its construction was sanctioned by different patrons at different stages, the major being Rani Utamde, wife of Padam Shah of Mewar, and Rani Devvadijee, wife of Rao Ganga. An outlet present at a lower level beneath Ranisar&apos;s overflow acts as the main source of water (cascading lake system). When Padam Sar is full, the brimming water flows from the top of the embankment and then right through the city. This system of water overflow from Ranisar into Padamsar was developed according to the engineering skills prevalent during Rao Maldeo&apos;s time and is still sustaining. </p>'

  - title: Jaita Bera
    id: jaita-bera
    about: '<p>Jaita Bera (well) is situated between <b><i>Fateh Pol</i></b> and <b><i>Kotawali</i></b>. It was constructed by Mutha Jeta during the reign of Rao Jodha Ji. Jaita bera is also known as <b><i>Rajkiya bera</i></b> (Royal Well). The water of this well is historically believed to have medicinal properties. Due to this reason water collection from here was directly governed by Mehrangarh Fort via their <b><i>kiledar</i></b> (head guard of the fort) or <b><i>kotwal</i></b> (regional police officer). If any person requested to use the water for any medicinal reason or even for any religious purpose, the required amount of water was provided to the person, with the permission of the kiledar. Keeping in mind the importance of this water, a soldier was always on duty to guard water collection.</p>'

    id: chand-bawri
    about: '<p>It was constructed by Rao Jodha ji&apos;s queen <b><i>Chand Kanwar</i></b>. Though it is very small in size, it is of great historical importance as its construction was done in the same era when the construction of the Fort was started. In ancient times, the plinth of Chand Bawdi used to have a temple and a Vachanalaya (Reading Room).</p>'

  - title: Community Wells
    id: community-wells
    about: '<p>Water bodies were also commissioned by different communities. The system of water bodies ensured the presence of a network of diverse, open spaces in an otherwise dense and compact city, integrating access to water with public spaces at all scales. At these wells, which are found in every chowk (square), which catered to residents of the local community, groups of people would collect and spend time together. Even the smallest <b><i>kuan/bera/well</i></b> had a plinth or an <b><i>otla</i></b> or steps, a tree, and often a pavilion as elements that enabled the creation of social space. Spilled water was collected in troughs for animals, a manifestation of the interstitial spaces of cultural expression of a society with strong bonds to animals in everyday life. The tree is often the <b><i>peepal</i></b> tree (sacred fig tree) that has religious significance. The daily prayers are recited here. Bird feeders are placed here. <img src="/images/peoples-treasure/community-wells/community-wells.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid w-100 my-3"> <span class="caption">An artistic representation of the space and activities around <i>Navchokia Bera</i>.

  - title: 'Matka: The Cycle of Life'
    id: matka
    about: '<p><b><i>Matka</i></b> is a local word for the commonly found terracotta drinking water pots across India. The spaces where the <i>matkas</i> are kept, are the most religious and sacred spaces of the Rajasthani household. The place to keep a matka is called <i>Parinda</i>. The <i>Parinda</i> has quite basic niches or ledges in the wall with circular rings at the bottom to hold the pots. In a residential space, historically two Parindas were constructed, first near the entrance for passersby and the other inside the kitchen for family consumption.</p><p>The Journey of Matka is a visual story captured within the spaces of the old city of Jodhpur presenting a transition of contexts around the matka from a potter&apos;s space to a vendor&apos;s shop followed by its use, the act of destroying and then being reborn in a different context. This visual story was produced by Maya Dodd, Vijayaditya Singh Rathore, Anshul Singh during the Jal Jharokha workshop, December 2021.</p>'

    about: '<p>Pyau is a community access point for drinking water usually stored in water pots or Matkas. Jal seva or the &apos;service of water&apos; is considered to earn spiritual merit to the sponsor and is a very popular practice in the desert. This photo zine is an experimental print-based work by Prachi Seksaria and Tisha Jain produced during the Jal Jharokha Workshop 2021. The zine presents photos of people and Pyau with a maze-like experience inspired by paths of the old city where these Pyau are found.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ByoEqCDmDpM" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>'

    about: '<p>Water has historically held an intimate relationship with people, particularly in the desert. During the Jal Jharokha workshop in December 2021, Aslam Saiyad and Twarita Jain walked across the old city of Jodhpur and had conversations with people on the streets about water, water heritage, water conservation and more. They captured verbal and visual cues from their interactions with people and compiled this story.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/msJjWo7ff_w" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>'

  <h3>Water into the Old City</h3>
  <p>Water collected via rainwater in large catchments percolates into the ground and due to the nature of the rock, it travels through its fissures making natural pathways. Water structures in Jodhpur historic city like bawdis (stepwell), jhalaras (square stepwell), bera (well), and kunds (reservoirs) are constructed on these natural pathways.  The water system in Jodhpur depends on seepage, percolation, and the water holding capacity of the rock strata. The water from hills and the higher region flows into reservoirs and further into the city enabled by the natural gradient. Jodhpur thus developed downstream where it could receive this water. This is the reason why a set of water bodies were constructed in a connected network.</p>

  <h3>Street from Padamsar to Navchokiya</h3>
  <p>The entrance that connected the historic walled city to the Mehrangarh Fort has two lakes beside it. Ranisar was reserved for the use of the Fort and Padam Sar was open for public use. The street that connects this entrance of the Fort to the walled city is again set on a hilly terrain along the foothills of Mehrangarh Fort. Because of the presence of this hilly terrain, the dwelling has a natural gradient thus enabling the flow of water. From the perspective of the water heritage of the old city, this street can be seen as having a series of the oldest water structures either commemorated by the then ruling kings or queens or a community head.</p>
