subtitle: Marwar Paintings and<br>Folk Music Celebrating Water
about: '<p>Work of art and music has the power to create a different world for a moment. These temporary worlds are shaped by the unbounded imagination of artists, their expressions that create a specific mood, to transport us somewhere between the real and the fantastical. Jodhpur has rich traditions of such artistic practices which flourished over centuries by royal patronage and cultural practices of common people. This story sheds light on only a few of the many examples of traditional music and miniature paintings that revered aspects of the water in the artistic history of Jodhpur.</p>'

        <p>Teej refers to the monsoon festival, observed particularly in western and northern states of India. The festival celebrates the bounty of nature, arrival of clouds and rain, greenery and birds with social activity, rituals & customs. The monsoon festival of Teej is primarily dedicated to Mata Parvati and her union with Lord Shiva. Teej refers to the third day that falls every month after the new moon (amavasya), and the third day after the full moon night of every lunar month.</p>
        <p>Teej festival is traditionally observed by women to celebrate months of Shravan. Here the painting shows dark, swirling monsoon clouds, the scene is set in a lush garden with marble pavilions. Maharaja Man Singh (r. 1803 - 43) is rejoicing passionately with his zenana. The royal party is feasting, swinging on a jhula, playing a game of dice (chauper), and indulging playfully in hide-and-seek. Peacocks dot the landscape, and the artist Dana has depicted women in pairs,echoing the mood of the season.</p>

        <p>Jodhpur has hills surrounding Mehrangarh Fort and is a catchment area for monsoon water that flows down into small and large depressions. Its medieval inhabitants converted them into lakes from where water was drawn to over hundreds of step-wells and jhalaras built in different periods of time in the walled city and beyond. Every neighborhood in the old city had its own baori. Similarly Royal Palaces were also built near the water catchment areas. As we can see in miniature paintings all the palaces had their own water bodies or jhalaras which brought life to the royal palace as these water bodies were the main source of water during the summer season. In this painting we can see the Sur Sagar palace and its water pond (Talab) on the right which is called the Sur Sagar Talab. The palace and pond were built by Maharaja Sur Singh in 1664. The marble Sur Sagar palace and Char Bagh pattern garden depicted by the artist in this painting are a visual delight.</p>

      <h3>Maharaja Bakhat Singh Revels in a Pleasure boat Ride, Nagaur</h3>

        <p>Ahhichatragarh, the fort of Nagaur, in the second quarter of the eighteenth century Maharaja Bakhat Singh (R. 1724-51) redeveloped the palace, setting his towers and pavilions among lush gardens, constructing huge water tanks for bathing and boating. It is a water palace set in a land of scanty rain. The point is to observe that they responded to nature by transforming it. The garden that defies the desert environment and raises a wall against it. The water system at the fort is integrated with gardens to enhance the experience, transformation and customization to weave in with the architecture makes their presence all the more pertinent to their making. The primary function of the fort as a leisure palace, and a stopover for the royal caravans between Delhi & Jodhpur with its camp-like references in architecture is enriched by the diverse open spaces. Many of the open spaces were clearly visualized as gardens with evidence of the plantation and vegetation seen in the miniature that adorn the palace. The sharpness and ruggedness of the stone can be imagined moderated by the soft filtering light, the hues of green and the chirping of the birds. The gardens tempered the harsh desert climate and provided the necessary relief.</p>
