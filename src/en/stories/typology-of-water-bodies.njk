    title: Bawdi
    about: '<p>In earlier times, <b>Bawdi</b> was usually constructed with a basic Stone masonry pattern and was dug according to the need for water. It was much later that stones were carved out from huge stone blocks by <b>Shilpi/ Karigar</b> (Stone Craftsmen) using <b>Chaini-Hathoda</b> (Chisel and Hammer). Bawdi is a form of the stepwell, where initial steps are short flights of criss-cross steps, with a condensed linear form. Stepwells usually consist of two parts: a vertical shaft from which water is drawn and the surrounding inclined subterranean passageways, chambers, and steps.</p>'

    title: 'Well / Bera / Kua'
    about: '<p>Well taps groundwater and occupies the most minimal area of all the water structures revealing very little above the ground. These tap subterranean rivers. This could be built in houses, temples, and also in open spaces. These had basic elements of the well shaft and water wheels. Open wells may either be unlined or sunk in the hard rock of hilly regions. These are typically community assets, shared amongst a number of families who share their construction, maintenance, and water resources.</p>'

    title: 'Tanka / Haus'
    about: <p>These are underground tanks that store rainwater harvested from terraces of residential spaces. Before the first rain, the terraces are cleaned and water during the first rain is allowed to flow through different spouts. After that, all the secondary spouts are closed and water is directed from a single spout to these tanks via courtyards or backyards of a space. During these times no one is allowed to take their footwear on the terrace or even visit the terrace. Thus making the water free of contaminants and pollutants and only aided by the lime terrace. These were also constructed in temples for the daily use of water for rituals and offerings. The forts also used to have the necessity to construct tanks for wars and attacks, where the army can utilize the in-house water supply. The farms also used to have these tankas, for irrigation purposes to be used when needed for drinking. Tanka is a closed rainwater storage system whereas Haus is an open rainwater storing water body. </p>
