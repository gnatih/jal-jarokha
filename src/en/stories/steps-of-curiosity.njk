subtitle: In, Above and Around<br> Tunwarji Ka Jhalra 
about: Queen Tunvar Ji, consort of Maharaja Abhaya Singh Ji commissioned the Jhalara in 1748 AD at the heart of Jodhpur walled city. This waterbody was later known as Tunvarji or Toorji ka Jhalara. This story presents pieces of poetry entangled in the spaces of this Jhalra. The sketches depict how these spaces find meanings for different activities and people. This work is produced in collaboration with a group of students from Anant National University.

  <div class="two-column">
    <p>The chowk where the jhalara is located is a densely populated area making the jhalara a highly utilized jhalara of the city. The top of one of the four sides of the jhalara has traces of a Persian wheel driven by a pair of bullocks to draw water from the jhalara. The other three sides have steps parallel to the sides in a zigzag pattern - an identity of the jhalara, to ensure physical access to the water. The jhalara is 200 feet deep and has carvings on the inner side of the tank. The position of the sun, the sky&apos;s reflection in the water, the geometry of the steps and the carvings play together and provide surreal imagery of the jhalara throughout the day. Even at night, the sides are designed with niches to place lamps for festivals. The spouts for water outlets are created in the shape of cows/bulls and lions, connecting its religious significance to Shiva and Parvati, and the festival of Gangaur. There are connected viewing galleries and pavilions also known as Chataries (memorial stone structures) and jharokhas used predominantly during the festivals. Locals now use these places as a platform to dive into the water. This architecture, combined with the open area surrounding the jhalara makes the square a bustling public place equally popular amongst locals as well as the tourist. During the conservation process, which was a public-private partnership, the tank was further dug up to clean the exposed carved Jodhpuri red sandstone - deities, animals, figurines etc.</p>
