title: Diverse Water Spaces
subtitle: Water Bodies & Structures<br> around Mehrangarh
about: <p>Historically people who resided in hot, desert regions have created various types of large-scale water reservoirs for storing and accessing water. Depending upon spatial characteristics and intended public, personal or community use, the water reservoirs had different designs. This story captures the diversity of the water bodies and structures which exist in the vicinity of Mehrangarh Fort. </p>

    title: Jhalra
    about: <p class="mb-0"><i>Jhalra</i> is a form of a subterranean structure, usually constructed in a space where water is filled up through cracks and fissures in the stone terrain underneath. The depth of <i>Jhalra</i> is higher as compared to its width or length. <i>Jhalra</i> has a flight of steps on its three edges leading to the level of water and the fourth edge usually has a verandah or Persian wheel to draw water. It is an excellent example of stone construction and engineering, the steps are a scaling device where each flight correlates approximately to the height of the human shoulder. </p>

    image_description: The picture here showcases <i>Maayla Bagh Jhalra</i> which was sanctioned by Gulab Rai, the concubine of Maharaja Vijay Singh Ji in the 18th century. It is said that this jhalara was an expansion of an existing bawadi and temple structure. Later, a few additions were made to the space by adding a few palace structures around it.

    title: Sar
    about: <p>Sar means Lake also known as Talab/Nadi/Sagar/Samand/Bandh/Kund. These are formed when a part of the catchment area or a part of the valley is enclosed with structural embankments, following the concept of dams. Depending upon the function of the dam superstructure, the reservoirs were termed Nadi, Talab, Sagar, Sar, Sambandh, or Bandh.</p><p class="mb-0">Larger reservoirs with a large catchment were termed Sagar or Samand while the smaller ones were called Kund and Talab. Nadi were reservoirs from the rural areas, whereas Bandhs were found in old, as well as, newly developed cities. Sar is the reservoir mostly found in the narrow catchments of dense cities.</p>
    id: padamsar
    image_description: The image here is of <i>Padamsar</i> which was sanctioned by Rani Uttamde Sisodini Ji who was the daughter of Rana Sanga of Mewar. During Maharaja Bakhat Singh Ji's reign, the embankment of Padamsar was raised by seven more steps for <i>tarpan</i> worship by the Shrimali Brahmin community.

    title: Sagar
    about: <p class="mb-0">Sagar refers to a tank. The term defines an enclosed built containment. In Jodhpur, the tanks were constructed to harvest water from the catchment areas within the city. The main connections of these tanks to lakes are different-sized canals.  These tanks  are referred to as <i>Sagar</i> in the vernacular language. The edges of these tanks consist of platforms and ghats-like steps.</p>

    image_description: The image shows Gulab Sagar which was sanctioned by Gulab Rai in 1845.  It took around eight years to complete the construction of Gulab Sagar. It measures 150 x 90 m in size and receives water through a canal from Bal Samand Lake.

    title: Bawdi
    about: '<p class="mb-0"><i>Bawdi</i>s were earlier constructed with a basic stone masonry and were dug according to the need for water. It was much later that stones were carved out from huge stone blocks by <i>Shilpi / Karigar</i> (Stone Craftsmen) using <i>Chaini-Hathoda</i> (Chisel and Hammer). Bawdi is a form of the stepwell, where initial steps are short flights of criss-cross steps, with a condensed linear form. Stepwells usually consist of two parts: a vertical shaft from which water is drawn and the surrounding inclined subterranean passageways, chambers, and steps.</p>'

    image_description: This example is of Tapi Bawdi, sanctioned by a Pandit named Tapi from the Pushkarna Brahmin community. This <i>bawdi</i> was constructed in the year 1675 during the reign of Maharaja Jaswant Singh Ji. The community living around the <i>bawdi</i> believes that the water of this <i>bawdi</i> is light and soft which makes this <i>bawdi</i> an ideal place to learn to swim.

    title: 'Bera/Kua'
    about: '<p class="mb-0">Bera or Kua means a well, which directly taps groundwater and occupies minimal physical structural space on the ground compared to all other water structures. Wells provide continuous water access from subterranean rivers. There are houses, temples and open community spaces around the beras.  Wells have two basic elements: a shaft and a water wheel. These are typically community assets, shared amongst a number of families who share their construction, maintenance, and water resources.</p>'

    image_description: The showcased water body here is <i>Jaita Bera</i> which was constructed during the reign of Rao Jodha, that is, it dates back to the foundation of Jodhpur. It was once reconstructed during the time of Maharaja Ajeet Singh.

    title: 'Tanka/Hauz'
    about: <p class="mb-0">Tankas are underground tanks that store rainwater harvested from the terraces of residential spaces. Before the first rain, the terraces are cleaned and water during the first rain is allowed to flow through different spouts. After that, all the secondary spouts are closed and water is directed from a single spout to these tanks via courtyards or backyards of a space. During this time, no one is allowed to take their footwear on the terrace or even visit the terrace. This makes water free from pollutants whilst further improved by a lime terrace. Lime is traditionally believed to be a water cleanser and used for the lining of terraces as well as <i>tankas</i>. These were also constructed in temples for the daily use of water for rituals and offerings. The Fort could also use water from <i>tankas</i> while under attack or in a war as an in-house water supply. The farms also used to have these <i>tankas</i> for irrigation purposes, to be used when needed for drinking. <i>Tanka</i> is a closed rainwater storage system whereas <i>Hauz</i> is an open rainwater storing water body. </p>
    id: tanka
    image_description: Shown here is an underground <i>Tanka</i> situated at Mehrangarh Fort under Daulat Khana Chowk which was constructed during the reign of Sawai Raja Soor Singh. It is said there was a cellar here earlier during the times of Rao Ganga.
