    title: 1. Dhobi Kund Catchment Area
    description: <div class="two-column">These gorges around Mehrangarh serve as the catchment area for its brilliant water management system. Dhobi Kund catchment area is nestled in the midst of the various hills northeast of the city and augments the catchment of Ranisar in the Southern direction as well as Sursagar in the western direction. The catchment spreads over rocky outcrops of red sandstone. During monsoon, streams of water flow like veins across this terrain towards a walled enclosure.</div>
